Spreads visible windows evenly over the monitor screen(s).

Calling the script a second or more times within a small period
makes the windows on the screen holding the active window rotate places.

I use it with a shortcut to the script.
First click divides the windows over the screen(s).
Successive clicks makes windows switch places on the screen with the active window.

Depends on: xdotool, xprop, xwininfo , wmctrl

I guess it can be done with less but it works and I don't feel the need to polish it now.
